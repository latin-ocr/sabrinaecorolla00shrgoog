SABRINAE coROLLA.

Tre Wronged Hurband.

Had it pleased heaven
Το try me with affliction3 had he rained
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head3
Steep’d me in poverty to the very lips;
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes 3
Ι should have found in some place os my soul
A drop of patience: hut, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the hand of scorn
Το point his slow unmoving finger at,—
0! O!
Yet could I bear that t003 well, very well:
But there where I have garner'd up my heart3
Where either I must live, or bear no life3
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up3 to be discarded thence!
Patience, thou young and rosc-lipp'd cherubim,
Ay, there, look grim as hell!
