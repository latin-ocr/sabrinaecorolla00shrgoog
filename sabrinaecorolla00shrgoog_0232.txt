198 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Poet'a Song. ·

The rain had follem the Poet arose,
And pass'd by the town, and out of the street3
A light wind blew from the gates of the sun,
And waves of shadow went over the wheat.
And he sat him down in a lonely place,
And chanted a melody loud and sweet,
That made the wild swan pause in her cloud,

And the lark drop down at his feet.

The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee,
The snake slipt under a spray,
The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak,
And stared with his foot on the prey;
And the nightingale thought: Ι have sung many songs,
But never a one so gay;
For he sings of what the world will be
When the years have died away.

Teunrsou.

Lines ia a Lodffa Album.

· Smadl service is true service, while it lasts3
Of humblest friends, bright creature, scorn not one:
The daisy, hythe shadow which it caste,

Proteots the lingering dewdrop from the sun.

Woanswoarn.
