SABRINAE COROLLA.

T hy Days are done.

Thy days are done, thy fame begun3
Thy country's strains record
The triumphs of her chosen son,

The sleughters of his sword3
The deeds he did, the fields he won,
The freedom he restored.

Though thou ert fallen, while we are free,
Thou shnlt not teste of death3

The generous blood that flow'd from thee
Disdained to sink beneoth:

Within our veins its currente be,
Thy spirit on our brenth. .

Thy neme, our charging hosts along,
Shnll be the battle-word3

Thy fall, the theme of choral song
From virgin voices poured.

To weep would do thy glory wrong;
Thou shalt not be deplored.
Brnor.

Sigt no more, Lndiee.

Sigh no more, indies, sigh no more:
Men were deceivers ever.
One foot on sea, one foot on shore;

To one thing constant never.
Snsxsmnr.
