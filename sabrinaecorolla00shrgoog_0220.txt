186 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T lie T oin Gode

And all the people trembled,
And pale grew every eheek3
And Sergius the high pontiff

Alone found voice to speak:

The gods, who live for ever,
Have fought for Rome to·day!
These be the great Twin Brethren

To whom the Dorians pray.

Baok comes the chief in triumph,

Who in the hour of fight
Hath seen the great Twin Brethxen
In harness on his right.

Sofe comes the ship to haven
Through billows and through galee,
If once the great Twin Brethren
Sit shining on the sails.

Mecium.

Juliet.
Ο God, Ι have an ill-divining soul;

Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb ε
Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookst pale.

Smenos.
