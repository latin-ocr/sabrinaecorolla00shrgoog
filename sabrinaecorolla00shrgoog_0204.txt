SABRINAE COROLLA.

Martinmas.

It is the day of Martelmas3
Cups of ale should freely pass.
What though winter has begun
To push down the summer sun?
To our fire we ean betahe,

And enjoy the crachling brake,
Never heeding winter's face

On the day of Martelmas.

Some do the city now frequent,
Where costly shows and merriment
Do wear the vapourish evening out
With interlude and revelling tout,
Such as did plensure England's queen,
When here her royal grace was seen3

Yet will they not this day let pass,
The merry day of Martelmns.

When the daily sports be done,
Round the market-cross they run,
Prentice lads and gallant blades
Dancing with their gamesome maids3
Till the beadle, stout and sour,
Shakes his bell, and calls the hour;
Then farewell lad and farewell laen
To the merry night of Martelmas.

Marhelmas shall come again,

spite of wind and snow and rain3

But many a strange thing must be done,
Many a cause be lost and won‚
