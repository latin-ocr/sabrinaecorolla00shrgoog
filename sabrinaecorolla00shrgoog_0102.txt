SABRINAE COROLLA.

John Anderson.

John Anderson my jo, John,
When we were first aequent,

Your looks were like the raven, John,
Your bonnie brow was brent;

But now your brow is bald, John,
Your locks are like the snew3

But blessings on your frosty pow,
John Anderson my jo.

 

John Anderson my jo, John,
We elnmb the hill thegither3
And monie a canty day, John,
We ’ve hod wi’ ane anither:
Now we maun totter down, John,
But hond in hand we'll go,

And sleep thegither at the foot,
John Anderson my jo.

Borms.

The Lion ond the Unicorn.

The lion and the unicom
Were fighting for the crown; .
The lion beat the unicorn
All round the town.
Some gave him white bread;
Some gave him brown;

Some gave him plum-sake,
And sent him out of town.

Gnmn Gomon.
