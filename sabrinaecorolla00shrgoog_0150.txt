11⁶ SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Lotus-enters.

Hateful is the dark-blue sky

Veulted 0'er the dark-blue sea.
Deeth is the end of life; ah, why

Should life all lebonr be?
Let us alone. Time driveth onwerd fast,

And in a little while our lips are dumb.
Let us alone. What is it that will last?

All things are taken from us, and become
Portions and parcels of the dreadsul past.

Let us alone. What plensure cen we have
To war with evil? Is there any peace

In ever climbing up the climbing wave?

All things heve rest, and ripen toward the grave
In silence, ripen, fall, and nense.
Give ue long rest, or death, dark death, or dreamfui

ease.
Tnnerson.
