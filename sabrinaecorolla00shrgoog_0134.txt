100 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tae Hoanch os Venison.
While thus I debated, in reverie centred,

An acquaintance—e friend, as he call'd himself-enter’d;

An underbred, fine-spoken fellow was 116,

And he smilcd as he lookcd at the venison and me.

“What have we got 116161 Why, this is good eating!

Your own, I suppose—or is it in waiting ?”

“ Why, whose should it be 1” cried I, with a flounce;

“I get these things often ”— but that was 6 bounce:

“Some lords, my acquaintance, 11161 settle the nation,

Α16 pleased to be kind—but l hate ostentation.”

“ If that be the case, then,” cried he, very gay,

“ I'm glad to have taken this house in my way. ¹

To-morrow you take a poor diuner with me;

No words—I insist on't-precisely at three:

We 'll have Johnson and Burke—all the wits will be
there ;

My acquaintance is slight, or I'd ask my Lord Clare.

And, now that I think on't, as I am 6 61111161,

We wanted this venison to make out a dinner.

What say you-a pasty? it shall and it must, ,

And my wife, little Kitty, is famous for crust—

Here, porter, this venison with me to Mile-end 3—

No stirring, I beg, my dear friend, my dear friend !’'

Thus snatching his hat, he brush’d off like the wind,

And the porter and estables follow’d behind.

Gonnstssnn.

Auf einen Reichen.
