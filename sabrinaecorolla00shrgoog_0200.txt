SABRINAE COROLLA.

llo Doiry.

There is a flower, a little flower,
With silver creat and golden eye,

That welcomes every changing hour,
And weathers every sky.

The prouder beautiea of the field
In gay but quiok auoceasion ahino,
Race after rece their honours yield,
They flourish and decline.

But this small flower, to Nature dear,
While moons and stara their coursea run,

Wreathes the whole circle of the year,
Componion of the sun.

It smiles upon the lap of May,

To sultry August spreads its charms‚
Lights pale October on his way,

And twines December's arnis.

Th'e purple heath and golden broom
On moory mountains catch the gale3
O'er lawns the lily aheds persume,
The violet in the vale.

But this bold flow’ret climbs the hill,
Hides in the forest, haunts the glen,
Plays on the margin oi the rill,
Peeps round the fox’s den.
