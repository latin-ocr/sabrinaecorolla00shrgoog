SABRINAE COROLLA.

Done into English by tht Shakrpcore.

Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
But wonder on, till truth makes all things plain.
This mau is Pyramus, if you would know 3
This beauteous lady Thisby is, certain.
This man, with lime and roughcast, doth present
walt—that vile wall that did these lovers sunder.
And through wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content
Το whisper; at the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lentem, dog, aud bush of thorn,
Presentcth moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which by name lion hight,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright.
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain:
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth aud tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain.
Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blado,
He bravely brocched his boiling bloody breast3
And, Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all thc rest,
Lethon, moonshine, wall, and lovers twain,
At large discourse, while here they do remain.

Pyramus

Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
Ι thauk thee, Moou, for shiuing now so bright:
