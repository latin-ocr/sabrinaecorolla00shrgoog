SABRINAE cottone.

The Sleep ostbe Breve.

How sleep the breve, who einh to rest
By all their country’s wishes blest?
When Spring, with dewy fingere cold,
Returns to deck their hallow'd mould,
She there shall dress a eweeter sod
Than Fancy’s feet have ever trod.

By fairy hands their knell ie rung3

By forms unseen their dirge is sung3
There Honour comes, a pilgrim gray,
To bless the turf that wraps their clay3
And Freedom shall awhile repair,

To dwell a weeping hermit there.

Coruus.

Epitaplz on the Countere osPembroke.

Underneath this marble hearse

Lies the subject of all verse;
Sidney's sister, Pembroke’s mother:
Death‚ ere thou hest slain another

' Fair, and good, and wise as she,

Time shall throw a dart at thee!

Ber J orrson.
