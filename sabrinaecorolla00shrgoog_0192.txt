158 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Nightingal.

A meiden fair in days of eld
Bemoaned her hapless fate:

The sire of gods and men beheld
With eye compassionate.

Forthwith transmuted to a bird,
Her deftly warbled tale

In many a forest-glade is heard:
She is-the Nightingele.

It so fell out, one summer's day,
Beneath a verdant hill,

She tuned her fullest, sweetest lay,
A consort's heart to thrill.

Love drenk the liquid notes, and strove
From that delicious hour

To work, in rivelry of Jove,
A deed of equal power.

The bird, whose music rich and rate
Entranced the listening wind,

He changed into a meiden fain

And she is—JENNY Lmn.
