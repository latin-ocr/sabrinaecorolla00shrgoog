SABRINAE COROLLA.

Virions os tlte Futuro.

I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,

Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that
would be ;

Sew the heavens fill with commeree, argosies of magio
sails, .

Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with oostly
beles3

Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained
a ghastly dew

From the nations’ airy novies, grappling in the central
blue;

Far along the world-wide whisper of the south wind
rushing warm,

With the standands of the peoples plunging through the
thunder-storm ;

Til] the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-
flags were furled

In the parliament of man, the federation of the world.
