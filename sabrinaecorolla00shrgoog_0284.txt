250 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The dame, the storm, the quaking ground,
Earth's joy, earth’s terror, nought is thine;

Thou must but hear the sound
Of the still voice divine.

Ο princely lot! Ο blissful art!
E’en while by sense of change opprest‚
Thus to foreeast in heart ’
Heaven’s age of fearless rest.

Paulm cvii. 23-80.

They that go down to the sea in ships,
And do business in great waters3

These men see the works of the Lord,

And his wonders in the deep.

For at his word the stormy wind ariseth‚

Which lifteth up the waves thereof.

They are carried up to the heaven, and down again to
the deep:

Their soul melteth away because of their trouble.

They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,

And are at their wit's end.

So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,

He delivereth them out of their distress.

For he meheth the storm to cease,

So that the waves thereos are still.

Then are they glad because they are at rest:

And so hebringeth them to the haren where they would
be.
