SABRINAE coROLLA.

To Mary in Heaven.

Thou lingering star, with less’ning ray
That lov’st to greet the early mom,
Again thou usherest in the day
My Mary from my soul was torn.
Ο Mary, dear departed shade!
Where is thy place of blisssul rest?
See’st thou thy lover lowly laid?
Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breaet?

That sacred hour can I surget,

Can I forget the hallowed grove,
Where by the winding Ayr we met,

To live one day of parting love?
Eternity will not efface

Those records dear of transports past3
Thy image at oue last embrace-

Ah, little thought we ’twas our last!

Ayr gurgling kiss'd his pebbled shore,
O'erhung with wild woods thick’ning green ;
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar
Twined amorous round the raptured scene;
The flowers sprang wauton to be ptest,
The birds sang love on every spray;
Till too, too soon, the glowing west
Proclaim’d the speed of winged day.

still o’er these soenes my mem’ry wekes,
And fondly broode with miser care3

Time but the impression deeper makes,
As streame their channels deeper wear.
