98 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The World't Wanderers.

Tell ine, thou Star, whose wings of light
Speed thee in thy fiery flight,
In what cavern of the night

Will thy pinions close now?

Tell me, Moon‚ thou pale and grey

Pilgrim of heaven’s homeless way,

In what depth of night or day
Se'ehest thou repone now?

Weary Wind, who wenderest
Like the world's rejected guest,
Hast thou still some secret nest

sunnine.

Contentment.

I care not, Fortune, what you me deny:

You cannot rob me of free Nature’e grace3

You cannot shut the windows of the shy,
Through which Aurora shews her brightening face
You cannot bar my constant feet to trace

The woods and lawns, by living stream, at eve.
Let health my nerves and finer fibres brace,

And I their toys to the great children leave:

Of fancy, reason, virtue, nought can me bereave.

Tnouson.
