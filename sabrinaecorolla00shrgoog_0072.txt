SABRINAE COROLLA.

Still mile, ye kind blue skies,
Though you1 son pines and dies—

Far o’er the sea!
Mm. Hmmm

»--..-—-—

The Braes ⁰f Yarrow.

0 Yarrow fields‚ may never min
Nor dew thy tender blossoms cover,
For there was basely elain my luve,
My luve, as he'd not been a lover.

Much Ι rejoyced that waefu' day3

I sang, my voice the woods returning:
But lang ere night the spear was flown

That slew my luve, and left me mouming.

Yet, oh, prepare the bed of luve,
With bridal sheets my body cover3

Unbar, ye bridal maids, the door,
Let in the expected husband-lover.

But who the expected husband is?
His hands, methinks‚ are bathed in slaughter:

Ah me! what ghastly spectre’s yon
Comes in his pale shroud, bleeding after?

Pale as he is, here lay him down3
Oh lay his cold head on my pillow3

Take aff, take aff these brida] weida,
And crown my careful head with willow.
