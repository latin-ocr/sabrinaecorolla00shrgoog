’ SABRINAE COROLLA.

Horatius Cocles.

When the oldest oash io opened,
And the largest lamp is lit;
When the ohestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit3
When young ond old in circle
Around the firebrands close3
When the girls are weaving baskets,
And the lads are shaping bows;
When the goodman mendo his armour,
And trime his helmet's plume;
When the goodwife’s shuttle merrily
Goes flushing through the loom3
With weeping and with laughter
stillis the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the breve days of old.

Mnemon.

Wanderer’s Noohtlied.

Gentle Peaoe, whose wond of power
Lulls to elumber woe ond pain,

In affliction's sternest hour
Thou const soothe the wildered brein.

Here Ι wonder tempest-driven,
Seeking comfort, secking rest3
Child of Hoeven,
Glide, O glide into my breast!
K. (from Goom.)
