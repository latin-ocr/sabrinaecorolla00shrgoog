SABRINAE COROLLA.

My Native Stream.

Pure stream, in whose transparent ware
My youthful limbs I wont to lave,
No torrente stain thy limpid source,
No rocks impede thy dimpling course:
Devolving from thy parent lake,
A charming meze thy waters make,
By bowers of birch‚ end groves of pine,
And hedges flower'd with eglantine.
still on thy banks‚ so gaily green,

May numerous herds and flocks be seen,
And lasses chanting o’er the pail,
And shepherds piping in the dale,

‘ And ancient faith that known no guile,
And industry embrown’d with teil,
And hearts resolved‚ and hands prepared,
The blessings they¹enjoy to guard.

Snornnrr.

Melody.

How deer to me the hour when daylight dies,
And sunbeams melt along the silent sea!

For then sweet dreams of other days arise,
And memory breathes her vesper sigh to thee.

And es Iwateh the line of light that plays
Along the smooth wave toward the buming west,
I long to tread that golden path of rays,

And think ’twould lead to some bright isle of rest.
Moonn.
