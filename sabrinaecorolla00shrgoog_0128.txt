SABRINAE COROLLA.

T he Siege os Corinth.

’Tis midnight: on the mountains brown
The cold round moon shines deeply down3
Blue roll the waters, blue the sky
Spreads like an ocean hung on high,
Bespangled with those isles of light,

So wildly, spiritually bright3

Who ever gazed upon them ahining,
And turn'd to earth without repining,
Nor wish’d for wings to flee away,

And mix with their eternal ray?

The waves on either shore lay there
Calm, clear, and azure as the air3

And scarce their foam the pebbles shook,
But murmur'd meekly as the brook.

The winds were pillow’d on the waves;
The banners droop'd along their atavos,
And, as they fell around them furling,
Above them shone the crescent corling3
And that deep silence was unbroke‚

Save where the watch his signal spolie,
Save where the steed neigh'd oft and ahrill,
And echo answer’d from the hill,

And the wide hum of that wild host
Rustled lilre leaves from coast to coast,
Aa rose the Muezzin's voice in air,

In midnight cal] to wonted prayer;

It rose, that chanted mournful strain,
Like some lone spirit's o’er the plain:

, 'Thrae musical, but aadly aweet,

Such as when winda and harp-strings meet,
