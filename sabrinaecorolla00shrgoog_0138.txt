Hero.

Leon. I know not3 if they spealr but truth of her,
These hands shall tear her3 if they wrong her honour,
The proudest of them shall well hear of it
Time heth not yet so ‹lried this blood uimine,

Nor age so eat up my invention,

Nor fortune mede such heroo of my means,
Nor my bad life rest me so much of friends,
But they shall find, awalred in such s lriud,
Both strength of limb and polioy of mind,
Ability in means, aud ohoice of friends,

To quit me of them throughly.

Frior. Panse swhile,
And let my counsel sway you in this case. ·
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
Let her awhile be seeretly kept in,

And publish it that she is dead indeed3
Maintain s mourning ostentation3
And on your family's old monument
Hang mournlul epitaphs‚ end do all rites
Thet appertain unto s burial.
Susrsrnsnu.

A Folre Foco Troe.

That there is falsehood in his looks
Ι must and will deny:
They say their muster is a lrnave3
Anrl sure they ‹lo not lie.
