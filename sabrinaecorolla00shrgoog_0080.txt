SABRINAE COROLLA.

To Ellen.

Though time has not wreathed
My temples with snow,

Though age hath not breathed
A spell o'er my brow3

Yet care's wither'd fingere
Press on me with pain;

The fleeting pulse lingere,
And lingere in vain.

The eyes which behold thee,
Their brightness is fluum

The arms which enfold thee,
Enfeebled are grown;

And friendship hath left me,
By fortune estranged3

All, all is bereft me,
For thou too art changed.

Ye5‚ dark ills have clouded
The dawning in tears3

Adversity shrouded
My ripening years;

Life's path, wild and doeary,
Draws nigh to its close3
Heart-broken and weary,
Ι sigh for repose.

The world shall caress thee,
When Ι cease to be;

And suns rise to bless thee,
Which smile not for me;
