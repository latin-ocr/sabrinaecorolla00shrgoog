SABRINAE COROLLA.

Freedom.

You ask me why, though ill at ease,
Within this region Ι subsist,
¹Whose spirits fail within the mist,

And longuish for the purple scos.

It is the land that freemen till,

That sober-suited Freedom chose;
. The land, where girt with friends or foce,
A man may speak the thing he will3

A land of settled government,

A land of just and old renown‚

Where Freedom broadens slowly down
From precedent to precedent.

Should bendcd unione persecute
Opinion, and induce a time
When single thought is civil crime,
And individual freedom mute3

Though Power should melre from land to land
The name of Britain trebly great3

Though every channel in the state
Should almost cholre with golden send 3-

Yet wast me from the herbour-mouth‚

Wild wind! I seek a warmer sky ;
And I will nee before I die

The palme and temples of the South.

Trnrrson.
