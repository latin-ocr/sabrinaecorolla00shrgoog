²00 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Milton.

Milton! thou should'st he living at this hour;
England heth need of thee3 she is a fen
Of stagnant waters3 altar, swerd, and pen,
Fireside‚ the heroic wealth of hall and bower‚
Have forfeited their ancient English dower
Of inward happiness. We are selfish men:
Oh! raise us up, return to us again,
And give us manners, virtue, freedom‚ power.
Thy soul was like a stas, and dwelt apart3
Thou had’st a voice whose sound was like the aea3
Pure as the naked heavens, majestis, free.
So didst thou travel on life's common way
In eheerful godliness3 and yet thy heart
'Ihe lowliest duties on herself did lay.

Woaoswoaan.

T he absent Reae.

Why is it that on Clara’s face

The lily only has a place?

Is it that the absent rose

Is gone to paint her husband’s nese?
