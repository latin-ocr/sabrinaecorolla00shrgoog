SABRINAE COROLLA.

Lamentation.

Swifter far than summer’s ssight,
Swilter far than youth’s delight,
Swifter far then happy night,

Art thou come and gone.
As the earth when leaves ere dead,
As the night when sleep is sped,

As the heart when joy is fied,
I am left lone, alone.

The swallow summer comes again3
The owlet night resumes her reign;

But the wild swan youth is fain
To fly with thee, false as thou.

My heart each day desines the morrow,
Sleep itself is turned to sorrow,
Vainly would my winter borrow

Sunny leaves from any bough.

Lilies for a bridal bed,

Roses for a matron's head,
Violets for a maiden dead,—
Pensies let my flowers be:
On the living grave Ι beer
Soatter them without a tear3
Let no friend, however dear,
Waste one hope, one fear forme.
