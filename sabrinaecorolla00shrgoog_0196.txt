SABRINAE conoLLA.

Ungrotesul Beouty.

Kn0w‚ celia, since thou art so proud,
'Twas I that gave thee thy renown:
Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd
Of common beauties liv'd unknown,
Had not my verse exhal'd thy name,
And with it imped the wings of fame.

That killing power is none of thine,

' Ι gave it to thy voice and eyes,

Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine;
Thou art my star, shin'st in my skieo.

Then dart not from thy borrow’d sphere

Lightning on him that fix’d thee there.

Chnnw.

Wioheo.

Sweet be hendreams, the fair, the young ;
Graue, beauty, breathe upon her;

Music, haunt thou about her tongue3
Life, fill her path with honour.

All golden thoughts, all wealth of days,
Truth, friendship, love surround her;
So may she smile till life be closed,

And angel-hands have crown'd her.
Bnnnu Commu.
