SABRINAE COROLLA.

My Boot is on tle Skore.

My boat is on the shore,

, And my bork is on the sea3

But before I go, Tom Moore,
Here’s a double health to thee!

Here’s a sigh to those who love me,
And a smile to those who hate3

And, whatever sky ’s above me,
Here’s a heart for every fate.

Though the ocean roar around me,
Yet it still shall bear me on;
Though a desert should surround me,

It heth springs that may be won.

Were ’t the last drop in the well,

As I gasp’d upon the brinh,
Ere my sainting spirits fell,
’Tis to thee that Ι would drink.

With that water, ae thio wine,
The libation I would pour
Should be-Peace with thine and mine,

And a health to thee, Tom Moore!
Breow.
