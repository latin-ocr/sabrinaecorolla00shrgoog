SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tella ert la Vre.

Seest thou yon berk? It left our hay

This morn on its adventurous way,
All glad and gaily bright;

And many a gale its impulse gave,

And many a gentlyheaving wave

N igh bore it out of sight.

But soon that glorious course was· lest,
And treacherous was the deep3
Ne'er thought they there was peril most
When tempest seemed asleep.

Telle est la vie!

Thet flower, that fairest flower that grew,
Aye eherished by the evening dew,

Ἴ And cheered by opening day3

That flower, which Ι had spared to cull‚

Because it was so beautiful,
And shone so fresh and gay;
Had all unseeu a deathly shoot,
The germ of future sorrow 3
And there was canker at its root,

That nipped it ere the marrow.
Telle est la vie!

I’ve watched from yonder mountain’s height
The waxing and the waning light,
· The world far, far below;
I've heard the thunder long and loud, >
I’ve seen the aunshine and the cloud,
The tempest and the bow ;
