SABRINAE COROLLA.

'1712 Roee.

As late each flower that sweetest blowe
I plucked, the garden's pride,
within the petals of a rose
A sleeping Love I epied.-

Asound his brows a beamy wreath
Of many a lucent hue;

All purple glowed his cheek beneath,
Inebriate with dew.

I softly seized the unguarded Power,
Nor eeared his balmy rest3

And placed him, caged within the flower,
On spotless Sara’s breast.

But when, unweeting of the guile,
Awoke the prisoner sweet,

He struggled to escape awhile,
And stamped his faery feet.

Ah, soon the soul-entrancing sight
Subdued the impatient b0y3

He gazed3 he thrilled with deep delight3
¹Then clapped his wings for joy.
