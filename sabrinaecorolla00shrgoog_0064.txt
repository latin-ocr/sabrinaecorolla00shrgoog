SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Slony Heort.

Whenoe comes my love, Ο hearne, disolose!
’Twas from her cheeks that shame the rose ;
From lips that spoyle the ruhie’s prayse;
From eyes that mook the diamond's blaze.
Whence comes my woe‚ as freely owne:
Ah, me! 'twas from a heart lyke stone.

The blushyng eheek speakes modest mynde,
The lips befitting mordes most kynde3

The eye does tempto to love's desym,

And seems to say, 'tis Cupid’s fire:

Yet all so faire but speake my moane,

syth noughte dothe saye the hearte of stone.

Why thus, my love, so kyndely speake

Sweet lyppe, sweet eye, sweet blushynge oheeke,
Yet not a hearte to save my paine?

Ο Venus! take thy giftes agaim

Make not so faire to cause our moane,

Or make a hearte that’s like our owne.

Ἢ

The Old Woman.

There was an old woman who had three sons,
Jerry ond James and John:

J erry was hanged, J ames was drowned,
John was lost and never was found3

And there was an end of her three sons,
J erry and James and John.

Gmme Gomon.
