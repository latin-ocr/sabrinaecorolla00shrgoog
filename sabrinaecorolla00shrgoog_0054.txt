20 SABRINAE GOROLLA.

Let ue love.

Owedding-guest! this soul hath been
Alone on a wide, wide sea:

So lonely ’twas‚ that God himself
Scaree seemed there to be.

Oh, sweeter then the marriage-feast,
’Tis sweeter far to me,
To wall< together to the kirk

With e goodly company!

To welk together to the kirk,
And all together pray3
While each to his great Father bonde,
Old men and babes, and loving friends,
And youths and maidens gay!

Farewell, forewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou wedding-guest!

He prayeth well who loveth well
Both man, and bird, and beast.

He prayeth best who loveth best
All things, both great and smalh
For the dear God who loveth us,

He made and loveth all.
Commod
