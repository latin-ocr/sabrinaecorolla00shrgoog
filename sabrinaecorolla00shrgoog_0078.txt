SABRINAE COROLLA

T albot.

My thoughts are like a potter's wheel;
I know not where Ι am, or what I do.
A witch, by sear not force, like Hannibal,
Drives back our troops, and conquers as she lists:
So bees with smoke‚ and doves with noisome steuch‚
Are from their hives and houses driven away.
They cail'd us, from our fierceness, English dogs;
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
Hark‚ countrymen! either renew the fight,
Or tear the lions out of England's coat3
Renounee your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
Sheep run not half so tirnorous from the wolf,
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.

The Grave. ⁴

There is a calm for those who weep,

A rest for weary pilgrimo found3

They softly lie and sweetly sleep
Low in the ground.

The storm that wrecks the winter sky
No more disturbs their deep repose‚

Thau summer evening's latest sigh

That shuts the rose.
J. Mouroousur.
