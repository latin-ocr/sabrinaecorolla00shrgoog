'suumne COROLLA.

The Beggur Maid.

Her anns across her breast she laid3
She was more fair then words can say:

Bure-footed came the beggar maid
Before the Kn'ng Cophetua„

In robe and erown the king stept down
Το meet and greet her on her way.

“ It is no wonder‚¹’ said the lords,

“She is more beautiful than day.”
As shines the moon in clouded skieS,
She in her poor attire was seen:
One praised her uncles, one her eyes,
One her dark hair and lovesome mien :
So sweet a face, such angel grace,
In all that laud had never been.
Cophetua swore a royal oeth:
This beggar maid shall be my queen.

Tenuneon.
