1²2 snnnlnan COROLLA.

All the earth and air
With thy voice is loud,

Aa, when night is bare,
From one lonely cloud

The moon rains out her heams, and heaven is oven,
flowed.

——

Silent Love.

Few the words that I have apohen3 true love's words
are ever few3

Yet by many a speechlesa token hath my heart dia-
eoursed to you.

Souh that to each other listen, hear the language of a

Read thhgshhhent tears that glisten in the tender trembling

When §heah eheek ia pale with aadnesa, dimmer grows
the light of mine,

And your smiles of aunny gladneaa in my face reflected

Thoughlslhlnxyeapeech is faint and broken, though my worda
are ever few,

Yet by many a voieeleas token all my heart is known to
you.

Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home:
Your house is on fite, youn children will burn.

Gamo Gomon.
