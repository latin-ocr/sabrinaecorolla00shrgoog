SABRINAE conotts.

And take along unmeasured tone,
To mortal minstrelsy unknown.

It seem’d to those within the wall
A cry prophetie of their fal13

lt struck even the besiegers' ear
With something ominous and dress,

. An undefined nnd sudden thrill,

Which makes the beart s moment still,
Then beat with quicker pulse, sshnmed
of that strange sense its silence framed3
Such as a sudden passing-bell

Wakes, though but for a stranger’s knell.

Ariel’s Song.‚

Where the bee sucks, there suck I;
ln a cowslip’s bell I lie,

There Ι couch when owls do cry3
On the bat’s back Ι do fly

After summer, merrilyt
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
