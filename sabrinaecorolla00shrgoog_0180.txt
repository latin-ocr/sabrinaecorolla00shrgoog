146 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Is lily-cradled: I alone awake.
My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,
My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim,
And I am all aweary of my lise.

T he Rore.

G0, lovely rose,

Tell her that wastes her time and me,
That now she knows,

When Ι resemble her to thee,

How sweet and fair she seems to be.

Tell her that 's young,
And shuns to have her greces spied,

That‚ hadst thou sprung
In deserte where no men abide,
Thou must have uncommended died.

Smell is the worth

Of beauty from the light retired:
Bid her come forth,

Suffer herself to be desired,

And not blush so to be adrnired.

Then die3 that she

The common fate of all things rare
May read in thee,

How small a part of time they share,

That are so wondrous sweet and fair.

Wsrren.
