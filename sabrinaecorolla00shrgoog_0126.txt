SABRINAE COROLLA.

Song.

Go, forget me: why should sorrow

O'er thot brow s shadow fling?

Go, forget me: end tomorrow

Brightly smile end sweetly sing.
Smile-though I shall not be near thee;
Sing-though I shall never hear thee:
May thy soul with pleasure shine,
Lasting es the gloom of mine.

Like the sun, thy presence glowing‚
Clothes the meanest things in light;
And when thou, like him, snt going,
Loveliest objects fede in night.

All things looked so bright about thee,
That they nothing seem without thee ;
By that pure and lucid mind

Earthly things were too refined.

Go, thou vision, wildly gleaming‚
Softly on my soul thot fell3

Go, forme no longer beaming—
Hope ond Beauty, fare ye well!
Go, and nll that onee delighted
Take, end leave me all benighted,—

Glory's buming generous swell,
Feney, and the poet’s shell.

Woms.
