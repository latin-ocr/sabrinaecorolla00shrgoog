SABRINAE COROLLA.

Alcides.

Alcides thus his roco began:

O'er insancy he swiftly ran:

The future god at first was more than man.
Dengers and toils and J uno’s hate

E'en o'er his cradle lay in weit,

And there he grappled first with fate:

In his young hand the hissing snakes he pressed;
So early was the deity confessed.

Thus by degrees he rose to J ove’s imperial seat:
Thus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great.

Duruuu.

The Narcissus.

I saw the pride of all the meadow,
At morn a gay narcissus blow
Upon a river's bank, whose shadow
Bloomed in the silver waves below.
By noontide's heat its youth was wusted,
The waters as they passed complained3
At eve its glories all were blasted,
And not one former grace remained.

While the mild rose, more safely growing
Low in the unaspiring vale,
Amidst retirement’s shelter blowing,

Long sheds its sweetness on the gale.
Cononis
