Lycidas.

Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more,
For Lycidas your eorrow ie not dead,
Sunlr though he be beneath the watery floor;
So sinks the day-star in the ocean-bed,
And yet anon repaire his drooping head,
And tricks his beamn, and with new-spangled ore
Flamen in the forehead of the morning sky:
So Lycidas sunl< low, but mounted high,
Through the dear might of Him that walk'd the waves
Where, other'groves and other streams along,
With neolnr pure his oozy'loc'ks he laves,
And hears the unexpressive‚ nuptia] song,
In the blest kingdoins meelr of joy and love.
’ “ ’ Mnron.

Ι Dirgo.

Fear no more the 'heat o' the sun,
Nor the furious winter's rages:
· Thou thy worldly taslr host done,
'Home art gone, and ta'en thy weges.
Golden lads and girls all must,

As ehimneyeweepern, come to dust.

Fear no more the frown o' the great3
Thou nrt past th'e tyrant's stroke:
Care no moreto clothe and eat,
To thee the reed is as the oak.
'I'he¹ eceptre, leoming, physio, must
All follow this, end come to dust.
Snnrsrrnnr.
