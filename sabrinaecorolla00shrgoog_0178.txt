SABRINAE COROLLA.

AEnorie.

There lies avale in Ida, lovelier
T han all the valleys of Ionian hills.
The swimming vapour slopes athwart the gion,
Puts forth an arm, and ereeps from pine to pino,
And loitem, slowly drawn. On either hand
The lawns and meadow·ledges midway down
Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars
The long brook falling through the cloven ravine
In cataract after cataract to the sea.
Behind the valley topmost Gargarus
Stands up and takes the morning3 but in front
The gorges, opening wide apert, reveal
Troas and llion's column'd eitadel,
The crown of Troas.

Hither came at noon
Mournful AEnone, wandering forlorn
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills.
Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck
Floated her hair, or seem'd todoat, in rest.
She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine,
Sang to the stillness‚ till the mountain shade
Sloped downwurd to her seat from the upper cliff.

O mother Ida, many-fountain’d Ida,
Dear mother Ida, hearken ere 1 die.
For now the noonday quiet holds the hill3

The grasshopper is silent in the grass3
The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,
Rests like a shadow3 ond the cicala sleeps.
The purple flowers droop; the golden bee
