22⁶ SABRINAE COROLLA.

He and She.

He. What the bee is no the floweret,
' When he looks for honey-dew
Threugh the leaves that close embower it,
That, my love, I'll be to you.

She. What the bank, with verdure glowing‚
Is to wavas that wander near, ἢ
Whispering kisses‚ while they're going, ’
That I'll be to you, my dear.

sae. But they say, the bee’s a rever,
That he’ll fly when sweets are gone3
And, when once the kiss is over,

Faithless brooks will wander on.

He. Nay, if flowers will leae their looks,

If sunny banks will wear away,
’Tis but right that bees and brooks
Should sip and kiss them while they may.

Mooar.

A Dialogue.

Sweet rose of May, sweet rose of May,
Whithea ah whither fled away ἳ-
What's gone no time can e'er restore:

I corne no more—1 come no more.
Manrvaar (from Sereno).
