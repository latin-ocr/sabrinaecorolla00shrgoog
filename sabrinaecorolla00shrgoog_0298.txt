SABRINAE COROLLA.

Christian Warsore.

Soldier, go-but not to claim

Mouldering spoils of earth-born treasure,
Not to build a vaunting neme,

Not to dwell in tento of pleasure3
Dream not that the way is smooth‚

Hope not that the thoms are roses3
Turn no wishful eye of youth
Where the sunny beam repones:
Thou host sterner work to do,
Hosts to out thy passage through;
Close behind thee gulfs are burning:
Forward !—there is no returning.

Soldier, rest—but not for thee
Sprends the world her downy pillow;
On the rock thy oouch must be,
While eround thee ohafes the billow3
Thine must be n watchful sleep,
Wearier than another’s waking3
Such a charge as thou dost keep
Brooks no moment of forsaking.
Sleep, as on the battle-field,
Girded, grasping sword and shield:
Those thou const not name or number
Steol upon thy broken slumber.

Soldier, rise—the weris done:
Lo, the hosts of bell are flying;
’Twas thy Lord the battle won3

J esus vanquirhed them by dying.
