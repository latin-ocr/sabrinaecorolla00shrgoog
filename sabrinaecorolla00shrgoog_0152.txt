SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Poor Scholot'e Song.

Death, old fellow! heve we then
Come et laet so near ench other?
Well, shake hands3 and be to me

A quiet friend, a faithful brother.

All those merry days are gone,
Gone with cash and health, old fellow,

When I read long days end nights,
And sometimes (with e friend) got mellow.

Newton! Euclid! fine old ghosts!
Noble books of old Greek learning!

Ah, ye left huge acheo behind,
Head end beart and brain ell burning.

How I toiled! For one now fled

l wore down the midnight taper,
Labouring, dreaming3 till one day

I wolre, and found my life-e vapour.

Yet I hoped (ah, laugh not now l)

For wealth and health and fame-the bubble!
So l climbed up wisdom’s steeps,

And got a foll, boy, for my trouble.

Now all ’s over. No one helped,
No one choered my strong endeavour3

So I sank, and called on thee,
And thou ’lt be my friend for ever.
