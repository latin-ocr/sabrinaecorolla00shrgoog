120 SABRINAE coltotLA.

lee Skylnrlc.

Heil to thee, blithe spirit!
Bird thou never wert,
That from heaven, or near it,

Pourest thy full henrt
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.

Higher still and higher
From the earth thou springen, ’
Like a cloud of fire3
The blue deep thou wingest‚
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.

In the golden lightning
Of the sunken sun,

O’er which clouds are brightening,
Thou dost float and run,

Like an unbodied joy, whose rece is just begun.

The pale purple even
Melts around thy flight3
Like a star of heaven
In the broad daylight
Thon art unseen, but yet Ι hear thy shriss delight.

Keen as are the arrows
Of that silver sphere‚
Whose intense lamp nerrows
In the white dnwn clear, s
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
