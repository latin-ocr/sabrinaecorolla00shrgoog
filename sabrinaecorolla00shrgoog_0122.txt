SABRINAE COROLLA.

T he Patriot.

Yc eldest gods,
Who, mindful of the empirc which ye held
Over dim chace, keep revengesul watch
On falling natione, and on kingly lines
About to sink for ever3 yc‚ who shed
Into the passions of earth's giant brood,
And their fierce usages, the nense of J ustice3
Who clothc the fatcd battlcments of tyranny
With blackness as a funeral pall, and brcathe
Through the prond halls of time-emboldenfd guilt
Portents of ruin, hear mc! In your presence,
For now I feel yc nigh, 1 dedicate
This arm to the destruction of the king
And of his rece! Ο keep me pitiless!
Expel all human weakness from my framc,
That this keen wenpon shake not when his heart
Should feel its point; and if hc has a child
Whose blood is needful to the sacrifice
My country aske, handen my soul to nhed it!

Tmounn.

King Chnrlet the Second.

Here lies our Sovereign Lord the King,
Whose word no man relies on;
Who never said a foolish thing,
And never did cwisc one.
