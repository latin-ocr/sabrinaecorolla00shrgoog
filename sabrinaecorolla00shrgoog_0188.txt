SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tte Battte ⁰f Hohenlinden.

On Linden‚ when the sun was low,
AJl bloodless lay th’ untrodden snow,
And dark as winter was the flow

Of Iser, rolling rapidly.

But Linden saw another sight

When the drurn beet et dead of night,
Commanding fires of death to light
The darkness of her scenery.

By torch end trumpet fest array‘d‚

Eaeh herseman drew his battle-blado,

And furious every charger neigh’d
To join the dreedful revelvy.

Then shook the hille with thunder riven,
Then rush’d the steed to battle driven,
And louder than the bolts of heaven

Fer flash’d the red artillery.

But reddet yet that light shall glow

On Linden’s hills of stained snow,

And bloodier yet the torrent flow
Of Iser‚ rolhng rapidly.

' 'Tis mom, but seerce yon level sun

Cen pierce the war-clouds rolling dun,
Where furious Frank and fiery Hun
Shout in their eulph'rous canopy.
