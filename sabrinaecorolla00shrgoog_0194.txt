SABRINAE COROLLA.

Marion.

Will ye gae to the ewe-bughts‚ Marion,
And wear in the sheep wi’ me ἲ

The sun shines sweet, my Marion,
But nae half sae sweet as thee.

Oh, Marion‘s a bonnie lass,

And the blythe blink’s in her e'e;
And fain wad Ι marry Marion,

Gin Marion wad marry me.

I've nine milch ewes, my Marion,
A eow, and a brawnie quey;
I'se gie them a' to my Marion
Just on her bridal day.

Om Sconrmn Sene.

The Indian Tree.

They tell us of nn Indian tree,
Which, howsoe'er the sun and sky

May tempt its boughs to wander free,
And shoot and blossom wide and high,

Yet better loves to bend its arms
Downwerds again to that dent earth,

From which the life, that filis and warms
Its grateful being, first had birth.

E’en thus, though woo'd by flattering friends,
And fed with fame (if fame it be),

This heaut, my own dear mother, bends
With love's true instinct back to thee.
