2³⁰ SABRINAE COROLLA.

Exton. Bolingbrolcc.

E. Great king, within this coffin Ipresent
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies‚
Richard of Bourdeaux, by me hither brought.

B. Exton, Ι thank thee not; for thou beat wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land.

E. From your own mouth, my lord, Ι wrought this

deed. “

Β. They love not poison that do poison need,
Nor do l thee: though I did wish him dead,
Ibate the murderer, love him murdered.
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
But neither my good word nor princely favour:
With Cain go wander through the shade of night,
And never shew thy head by day nor light.
Lords‚ I protest my soul is full of woe
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.
Come mourn with me for what 1 do lament,
And put on sullen black incontinent.
I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Laud,
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
March sadly after: grace my mourningo here,
ln weeping after this untimely bier.

Summum.

Looea Circle.

Love is a circle that doth evcr move

In the rame sweet eternity of Love.
