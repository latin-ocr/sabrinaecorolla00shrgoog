176 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Parisino.

But it is not to list to the waterfall

That Parisina leaves her hall;

Auditis not to gaze on the heavenly light

That the lady walks in the shadow of night ;

And if she sits iu Este’s bower,

’Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower;

She listeus-but not for the uightingale,

Though her ear expects as soft u tale.

There glides a step through the foliage thick,

And her cheek grows pule, und her heart beats quiclr 3
There whispers a voice through the rustling leaves,
And her blush returns and her bosom heaves:

A moment more, and they shall meet 3

’Tis past-her lover 's ather feet.
Bmou.

Musque.

Spring all the graues of the age,

And all the loves of time;
Bring all the pleasures of the stage,

And relishes of thyme3
Add all the softnesses of courts,
The looks, the laughters‚ and the sports3
And mingle all the sweets and mults,
'that noue may say, The triumph halts.

Bru Jousou.
