260 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Peolm cxxxix. l·7.

Ο Lord‚ thou hest eearehed me out, end known me:
Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising3
Thou understendest my thoughts long before.

Thou ert about my path ond about my bed,

And spiest out all my ways.
For lo there is not a word in my tongue.

But thou, O Lord‚ knowest it altogether.

Thou hest fashioned me behind and before,

And laid thino hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful and excellent for me:
Ι cannot attain unto it.

Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit,

Or whither shall I go from thy presence?

lfl elimb up into heaven, thou art there:

If I go down to hell, thou art there also.

Grace.

The misty clouds that fall sometime
And overcast the skies
Are like to troubles of our time,

Which do but dim our eyes.

But as such dews are dried up quite
When Phoebus shews his face,
So are sad fancies put to flight

When God doth gulde by grace.
Gesooroxr.
