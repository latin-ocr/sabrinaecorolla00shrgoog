266 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Pasa the meam-before thee lies
All the conquerod land of glory:
Hark what songs of rapturo rise3
These proclaim the victor’s story 3
soldier, lay thy weapons down,
Quit the swerd, and take the crown3
Triumph! all thy foes are banished,
Death is slain, and earth has vanished.

Oninnonnn Ennnnnnn.

-.-....—-—-—-

Heaven.

This world is all a fleeting show,
For man’s illusion given 3
The smiles of joy, the tears of noe,

Deceitful shine, deceitful fl0w;
There’s nothing true hut Heaven.

And false the light on glory's plume
As fading hues of even ;
And love, and hope, and beauty's bloom‚
Are blossoms gather'd for the tomb3
There 's nothing hright but Heavon.

Poor wanderers of a stormy day,
From wave to wave we’re driven,

And fanoy’s flash and reason’s ray
Serve but to light the troubled way;

There’s nothing caim but Heaven.
Moonn.
