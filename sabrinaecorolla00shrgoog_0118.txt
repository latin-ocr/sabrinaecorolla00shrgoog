SABRINAE COROLLA.

Spring.

The soote senson, that bud and blome forth brings,

With grene hath elad the hill end eke the vale5
Tho nightingale with sethers new she sings;

The turtle to her mete heth told her tale:
Somer is come, for every spray now springs;

The hart hath hong his old hed on the pale 3
The buck in brake his winter eoate he flings;

The fishes flete with new repaired scele3
The adder all her slough away she flings;

The swift swalow pursneth the flies smale3
The busy bee her hony now she mings3

Winter is werne, that was the flowers bale:

And thus I se among these pleasant things
the cere deoeys3 end yet my sorow springs.

Norna.

Dark ore thy words end severe,
Thou dweller in the stone;
But tnembling and sear
To her are unknown,
Who hath sought thee here
In thy dwelling lone.
Come what eomes soever,
The worst I cen endure;
Life is but a short sever,

And death is the eure.
