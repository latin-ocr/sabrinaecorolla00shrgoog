172 SABRINAE con0LLA.

Many a tool must leave his pelf,
Many a worldling cheat himself,
And many a marvel corne to pass,

Before return of Martelmas.

The Faitllesr K night.

To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
Ah, miserable and unkind‚ untrue,

Unknightly, unitor-hemed! Woe is me!
Authority forgets a dying king,

Laid widowed of the power in his eye

That bowed the will. I see thee what thou art.
For thou the latest left ol* all my knights,

In whom should meet the offices of all,

Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
Either from lust of gold, or lilre a girl

Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.

Yet for a man may fail in duty twice,

And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
But if thou spare to ffing Excalibur,

I will, arise and slay thee with my hands.
Tmmrson.
