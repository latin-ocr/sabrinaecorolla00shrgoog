SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Lee-Slwre.

, Sleet, and hail, and thunder!

And ye winds that rave,

Till the sands thereunder
Tinge the sullen νᾶνος

Winds, that like a demon,
Howl with horrid note

Round the toiling seaman
In his tossing boat!

From his humble dwelling
On the shingly shore,

Where the billows swelling
Keep such hollow roar 3-

From that weeping woman,
Seeking with her eries
Succour superhuman
From the frowning skies 3-

From the urchin pining
For his father’s knee 3—

From the lattice shining‚
Drive him out to sea!

Let broad leugues dissever
Him from yonder foam.
O God! to think man ever

Comes too near his home!

Hoon.
