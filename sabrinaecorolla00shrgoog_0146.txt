112 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ι Sonnet.

One day I wrote her name upon the strand,
But came the waves ond washed it away3
Again I wrote it with a second hand,

But came the tide and mado my pains his prey.
“ Vain man,” said she, “that dost in vain assay
A morta] thing so to immortalise 3

For I myself shall h'ke to this decay,

And eho my name be wiped out likewise.’'
“Not so,” quoth I ς “let haser things devise
To die in dust, hut you shall live by fame:

My verse your virtues rare shall eternise,

And in the heavens write your glorious name;

where, whenas death shall all the world subdue,

Our love shall live, and later life renewJ'
sponsos.

⁸ The Porting Gist.

Take this ring, the simple token
Of o true and loving heart3
Could the spell of fate be broken,

Never, never would we part.

Soon we lose whate'er is sweetest;
Soon we ring enjoyment'skne115

F ondest hopes are ever fleetest 3
Therefore, dear one, fare thee well.
