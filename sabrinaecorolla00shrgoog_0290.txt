SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tlre Restitution of Mon.
0 Son, in whom my soul heth chief delight,

Son of my bosom, Son who art alone

My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,

All host thou spoken as my thoughts are, all

As my eternal purpose hath decreed:

Man shall not quite 1131031, but saved who will3
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me

Freely vouohsofed3 once more Ι will ronow

His lapsed powers, though forfeit, and enthrolled
By sin to foul exorbitant desires; .

Upheld hy me, yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his morta] f0e;

By me upheld‚ that he may know how frail

His fanen condition is, and to me owe

All his deliveranoe, and to none but me.
Moron.

Twosold Hope.

Refleoted on the lake, I love
To see the stars of evening glow,
So tranquil in the heaven above,
So restless in the wave below·

Thus heavenly hope is all serene3
But earthly hope, how bright soe’er,
Stil} ssutters o'or this ohanging soene,

As salse, as fleeting, as 'tis fair.
