SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Recoll.

Come again, come again!
Sunshine cometh after rein.
As s lamp fed newly humeth,
Pleasure, who doth fly, remmoth,
Scattering every cloud of pain.
As the year, which diesin showers,
Riseth in a world of honere,
Cell'd by many a vernal strain,
Come thou, for whom tears were falling,
And a thousand tongues are calling3
Come again, oh come again!
Like the sunshine after rain.

Sonnet.

Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the derling buds of May,
And summer’s lease heth all too short a dale:
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd3

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm’d.
But thy etemal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest3

Nor shall Death breg thou wander’st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou gronest:

So long as men cen breathe, or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
