222 SABRINAE COROLLA.

To the Genius oftlaee Hoose.

Command the roof, great Genius, and from thence
Into this house pour' down thy influence,

That through each room a golden pipe may run
Of living water by the benizon;

Fulfil the lundors, and by strength'ning bread

Be evermore thy bins replenished.

Next‚ like a bishop, consecrate my ground,

That lucky fairies here may donce their round 3
And, after nbat, lay down some silver peuce,

The master's charge and cane to recompense3
Charm then the chambers5 make the beds for ease,
More than for peevish pining sicknesses3

Fix the foundation fast, ond let the roof Α

Grow old with time, but yet keep weather-proof.

Hannon.

Forget T hee?

Forget thee ! —bid the forest-birds forget their sweeoest

Forget thteffibid the sea forget to swell beneath the

Bid the ῐζτίἰζ nowers forget to drink the eve’s refresh-

Thyselffonlggefflino own deor land, andito mountains
wild ond blue3

Forget each old familiar face, each long-remembered

When thessPoOttnings are forgot by thee, then thou shalt

be forgot. 1
