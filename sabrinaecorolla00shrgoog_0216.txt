The Primrose.

Ask me why I send you here

This firstling os the infant year;

Ask me why I send to you

This primrose all bepearl’d with dew;

I straight will whisper in your ears,

The sweete of love are wash'd with tears.

Ask me why this flower doth show
So yellow, green, and sickly t003
Ask me why the etalk is weak,

And bending, yet it doth not break ;
I must tell you, these discover

What doubts and fears are in a lover.

And Phoebus 'gius arise,
His steeds to water et those springs
On chaliced flowers that lies t
And winking marybuds begin
To ope their golden eyes;
With every thing that pretty bin3
My lady sweet, arise.
