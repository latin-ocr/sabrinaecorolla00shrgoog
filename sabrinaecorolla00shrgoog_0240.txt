SABRINAE COROLLA.

A Loner’s Liberty.

Away with those aelf-loving lads,
Whom Cnpid's arrow never gleds!
Away poor souls that sigh and weep
ln love of those that lie asleep! .

For Cupid is a merry god,
And forceth none to kiss the rod.

My songs they be of Cynthia’s pruine,
I wear her rings nn holidnys‚

’ In every tree Ι write her name,

And every day Ι read the same.
Where Honour Cupid’s rival is,
There miracles are seen of his.

If Cynthia crare her ring of me,
I blot her name out of the tree3
If doubt do derken things held deer,

Then well-fare nothing once a year.
For many run, but one must wint

Fools only hedge the cuckoo in.

Barney Bodlrin broke his none.

Want of victuale makes us sad,
Without feet we ean't have toes.

Crazy folks are always mad.
