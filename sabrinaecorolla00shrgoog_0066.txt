SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tae Mariner.

Ye winda which sweep the grove’s green topa‚
And kias the mountains hoar‚

Oh softly stir the ocean-waves
That sleep along the shore3

For my love sails the fairest ship
That wantons on the sea;

Oh bend his mast with pleasant galea,
And wast him hame to me.

Oh leave nae mair the bonnie glen‚
Clear stream, and hawthorn grove,

Where first we walked in gloaming gray,
And sighed and looked of love.

For faithless ia the ocean-ware,
And faithless is the wind;

Then leave nae mair my heart to break

’Mang Scotland's hills behind.

To a Lady.

For me no roseate garlanda twine,
But wear thern, demeat, in my atead3
Time hath a whi ter hand than thine,
And lays it on my head.

Enough to know thy place on earth
Is there where roses latest die;
To know, the steps of youth and mirth

Are thiae, that pass me by.
H. Tarroa.
