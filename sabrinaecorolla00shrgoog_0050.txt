SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Spirit os Leve.

A spirit there is, whose fragrant sigh
Is hurning now through earth and air:
Where cheeks are blushing, the Spirit is nigh3

Where lips are meeting, the spirit is there!

His breath is the soul of flowers like these ;
And his floating eyes‚- oh, they resemble
Blue water-filies, when the breeze
Is making the stream around them tremble!

Hail to thee, hail to thee, kindling power!
Spiris of love! spirit of bliss!
Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour,
And there never was moonlight so sweet as this.

By the fair and bravo, who blnshing unite,
Like the sun and wave when they meet at night!
By the tear that shews when passion is nigh,

As the rain-drop flows from the heat of the sky!

By the first love-beat of the youthful heart;

By the bliss to meet, and the pain to part!

By all that thou hast to mortels given,
Which-oh, could it last, this earth were heaven!

We call thee hither‚ entranoing power!
Spirit of love! Spirit of bliss!
The holiest time is the moonlight hour,
And there never was moonlight so sweet as this!

Moonr.
