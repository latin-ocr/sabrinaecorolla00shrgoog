178 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Take, olz take those lips away.

Tales, oh take those lips away,
That so sweetly were forsworn;

And those eyes, the break of day,
Lights that do misleed the mom:

But my kisses bring again,

Seals of love, but sealed in vain. ’

Hide, oh hide those hills of enom,
Which thy frozen bosom beers,

On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April weers:

But first set my poor heart free,

Bound in those icy chains by thee.

Inscription on a Boat.

They say that I am small and frail,

And cannot live in stormy sees.
It may be s03 yet every sail
Makes shipwreck in the ewelling breeze.

Nor strength nor size can then hold fest,
But Fortune’s favour, Heaven’s decree.
Let others trust in oar and mast,
But may the gods take care of me!

G. Mrmvmr (from tte Greek).
