196 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Eoe.

With thee conversing, Iforget all time,

All seasons, and their change; all please alike.

Sweet is the hreath of moru, her rising sweet,

With charm of earliest birds; pleasant the sun,

When first on this delightful land he spreads

His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,

Glistering with deu: fragrant the fertile earth

After soft showers3 and sweet the coming on

Of grateful evening mild; then silent night,

With this her solemn bird3 and this fair moon,

And these the gems of heaven, her star-ry train.

But neither brenth of morn, when she ascends

With oharm of earliest birds; nor rising sun

On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,

Glistering with dew3 nor fragrance after showers3

Nor grateful evening mild; nor silent night,

With this her solemn bird3 nor wall( by moon,

Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
Muros.
