232 SABRINAE COROLLA '

The Etrurion Noenio.

Where art thou, pale and melancholy ghost?

No funeral rites appense thy tombless clay;
Unburied‚ glidest thou by the ‹lismal coast,
Ο exile from the day?

There where the voice of love is heard no more,
Where the dull wave moans back the eternal wail,
Dost thou recall the summer suns of yore,
Thine own melodious vele?

Thy lares stand on thy deserted floors‚
And miss their last sweet daughter’s holy face:
What hand shall wreathe wi th flowers the threshold doors?
What child renew the racel

Thine are the nuptials of the dreery shades;
Of all thy groves what rests l - the cypress tree l
As from the air a strain ol music fades,
Dark silence buries thee.

Yet no, lost child of more than mortal sires,
Thy stranger bridegroom bears thee to his home,
Where the stare light the AEsar’s nuptial fires

In Tina’s azure dome;

From the fierce ware the god’s celestia] wing
Rapt thee alost along the yielding air5
With amaranths fresh from heaven’s eternal spring
Bright Cupra braids thy hair.
