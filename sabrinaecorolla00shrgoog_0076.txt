42 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T lte Fortunate Laud.

Know’st thou the land, where hange the citron-flower,
Where gleams the golden orange in the bower,
Where gentle zephyrs in the blue sky play,

And myrtles ereep beneath the towering bay?
Know’st thou indeed?

Oh there, oh there
Would I with thee, my best-beloved, speed.

Know’st thou the house, that rests on columns tall,
Its gay saloon, ita glitt'ring banquet-hall,

Where marble statues standand gaze on me :-
what have they done, thou hapless enin, to thee?

Know'st thou indeed?
Oh there, oh there

Would I with thee, my own kind guardian, speed.

Know'st thou the mount, andita cloud-created ateep,
Where poring mules the misty pathway keep ς
In caves the dragon hides her ancient brood;
Down leaps the roch, and over it the flood?
Know’st thou indeed?

Oh there, oh there
Our journey tends; my father, let ua speed.
