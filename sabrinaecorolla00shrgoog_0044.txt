10 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Prometheae.

No change, no pause, no hope! Yet Ι endure.
I ask the earth, have not the mountains felt?
I aak yon heaven, the all-beholding aun,

Has it not seen? The sea, in storm or calm,
Heaven’s ever-changing shadow, spread below,
Have ita deaf wavea not heard my agony?

Ah me! alas, pain, pain ever, for ever!

The erawling glaciers pierce me with the spears
Of their moon-freezing crystals3 the bright chains
Eat with their buming cold into my hones.
Heaven’s winged hound, polluting from thy lips
His beak in poison nothis own, tears up

My heart3 and shapeless sights come wandering by,

The ghaatly people of the reahn of dream,
Mocking me: and the earthquake fienda are charged
To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds.
