2³4 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ah, in those halle for us thou wilt not mourn3
Far are the AEsar's joys from human woe 3
But not the less forsaken and forlorn
Those thou hast left below.

Never‚ oh never more shall we behold thee,
The last spark dies upon the sacred heerth:
Art thou less lost, though heavenly arms enfold thee -
Art thou less lost to earth l

Slow swells the sorrowing Naenia's chaunted strala,
Time with slow flutes our leaden footsteps keep3
sad earth, whate’er the happier heaven may gain,
Hath but a loss to weep.

The Liger os Love.

She is not fair to outwerd view,
As many maidens be;
Her loveliness I never knew
Until she smiled on me:
Oh, then I saw her eye was bright3
A well of love—a spring of light.

But now her looks are coy and cold,
To mine they ne’er reply3
And yet I cease not to behold
The love-light in her eye :
Her very frowns are better far
Than smiles of other maidens are.
