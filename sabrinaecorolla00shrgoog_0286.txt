252 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Better Laod.

Ι hear thee apeak of the better land,

Thou calleat its children a happy band:

Mother, oh where is that radiant shore;

Shall we not aeek it, and weep no more?

Is it where the flower 01 the orange blows,

And thefire-flies danee through the myrtleboughs 2-
Not there, not there, my child.

is it where the feathery palm-trees rise,

And the date grows ripe under sunny skies;

Or midst the green islands of glittering aeas,

Where fragrant foresto perfume the breeze,

And strange bright birds on their starry wings

Bear the rich hues of all glorious things 1-
Not there, not there, my child.

is it far away in some region old,

Where the river wanders o’er sanda of gold,

Where the burning rays 01 the ruby shine,

And the diamond lights up the secret mine,

And the pearl gleams forth from the cora] strand ς

Is it there, sweet mother, that better land 2-
Not there, not there, my child.

Eye bath not seen it, my gentle boy3

Ear bath not heard its deep songs of j0y3

Dreams cannot picture a world so fair,

Sorrow and death may not enter there;

Time doth not breathe on its fadeless bloom3

For beyond the clouds and beyond the tomb‚
It is there, itis there, my child.
