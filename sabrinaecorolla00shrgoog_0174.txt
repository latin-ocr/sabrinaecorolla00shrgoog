——--

The Mollier's Stratogem.

While on the cliff with calm delight she kneels,
And the blue vales a thousand joys recall,
See to the last, last verge her infant steals!
Ο fly- yet stir not, speak not, lest it fall.
Far better taught, she lays her bosom bare,
And the fond boy springs back to nestle there.
