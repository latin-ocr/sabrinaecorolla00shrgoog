268 SABRINAE COROLLA.

77ae Praise os God.

Ye miste and exhalatione, that now rire

From hill or steaming lake, duslry or grey

Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,

In honour to the world’s great Author rise3 '
Whether to decl( with clouds the uncolour’d sky,
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,
Rising or falling, still advance his praise.

His preire, ye winds, thet from four quarters blow,
Breathe soft or loud3 end wave your tops, ye pines,
With every plant, insign of worship weve.
Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow,
Melodious murmurs‚ warbling tune his preire.

J oin voices, all ye living souls3 ye birds,

That singing up te heaven-gete ascend,

Beer on your wings andin your notes his praise.
Ye thatin wetere glide, and ye that wall<

The earth, and stately treed, or lowly creep3
Witness if Ι herilem, morn or even,

To hill or velley, fountain or fresh shade,

Made vocal by my song, and taught his preire.

vm Parirh Priest to hir Successor.

1f thou dost find
A house built to thy mind
without thy eost,
Serve thou the more
God and the poor;
My labour is not lost.
Hrrrrrrrr.
