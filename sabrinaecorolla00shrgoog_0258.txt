224 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Tae Soldiery of Hell.

Then straight commands, that, at the warlike sound
Os trumpets loud and clarioris, be uprear'd

His mighty standard: that proud honour clnim’d
Azazel as his right, a cherub tall,

Who forthwith from the glittcring staff unfurl'd
'l'he imperial ensign3 which, full high advanced,
Shone h'ke a meteor streaming to the wind,
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed,
Seraphic arms and trophies3 all the while

Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds;

At which the universal host up·sent

A shout, that tore hell's concave, and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.

All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air

With orient colours waving: with them rose

A forest huge of spears3 and thronging helms
Appear’d, and serried shields in thick array

Of depth immeasurable: enon they move

In perfect phalanx to the Dorion mood

Of flutes and soit recordem3 such as raised

Το height of noblest temper heroes old

Arming to battle3 and instead of rage,

Deliberate valonr breathed‚ firm and unmored
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat:

Nor wanting power to mitigate and 'sungo

With solemn touchcs troubled thoughts, and chose
Anguish‚ and doubt, and sear, and sorrow, and pain

From mortal or immortol minds.
Muros.
