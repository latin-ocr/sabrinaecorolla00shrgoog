Beer.

Therefore doth Heaven divide

The stete of man iu divers functione,

Setting endeavour in continual motion;

To which is fixed, es an eim or butt,
Obedience: for so work the honey·beee;
Creetures thet, by a rule in nature, teach

The act of order to a peopled kingdom.

They have a king, and officere of sorte:

Where some, like magistrates, correct et home;
Others, like merchantr, venture trade abroad3
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds;
Which pillage they with meny march bring home
To the tent royal of their emperor:

Wh0, husied in his majesty, surreys

The singing masone building roofs of gold;

The civil citizens kneading up the honey;

The poor mechanic porters crowding in

Their heovy burdens et his narrow gate3

The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
Delivering o'er to executore pole
The lezy yawning drone.

Surrentino.

Cock Robin.
Who killed Cock Robint

I, says the Sparrow,
With my bow and arrow,

l killed Cock Robin.
