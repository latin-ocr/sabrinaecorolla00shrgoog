Sonnet.

This morning timely rapt with holy fire,
Ι thought to form unto my zealous Muse
What kind of creature Ι could most desire
To honour, serve, and love, as poets use.
I meant the day-star should not brighter riso,
Nor lend like influence from his lucent seat3
I meant each softest virtue there should meet,
Fit in that soster bosom to reside.
Only a learned and a manly soul
I purposed her, that should with even powers
The noch, the spindle, and the shears control
of Destiny, and spin her own free hours:
Such when Ι meant to feign, and wished to see,
My Muse bade Bedford write, aud that was she.

T te Exile’t Return.

Art thou the strand l loved in early days,
The golden bench that saw my childish plays,
Home of my heort, when oceans rolled between,

And still remernbered, though so long unseeu?
Art thou the strand? Art thou the strand?
0 joy! thou art my own dear Fatherlend.

K. (from tte Gomon.)
