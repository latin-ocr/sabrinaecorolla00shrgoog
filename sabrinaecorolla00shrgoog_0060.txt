SABRINAE cortona

The Late hoa buret.

The lake has burst! the lake has burst!
Down through the chasma the wild waves flee;
They gallop along,
With a roaring song,
Away to the eager awaiting sea!

Down through the valleys, and over the rocks,
And over the foreste, the flood runs free3 ’
And wherever it dashes,
The oaks and the ashes

Shrink, drop, and are borne to the hungry sea!

The eottage of reeds and the tower of stone,
Both shaken to ruin, at last agree3

And the slave and his master,

In one wide disaster,
Are hurried, like weeds, to the scornful sea!

The sea-beast he tosseth his foaming mene,
He bellows aloud to the misty sky;
And the sleep-huried Thunder
Awekens in wonder,
And the Lightning opens her piereing eye!

There is death above, there is death around,
There is death wherever the waters be;
There is nothing now doing,
Save terror and min,

Ie earth, and in air, and the stormy sea!
Bannr Connwrrt.
