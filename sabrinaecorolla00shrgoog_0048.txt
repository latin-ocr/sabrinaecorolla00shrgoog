SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ι saw thee weep.

I saw thee weep-the big bright tear
Came 0’er that eye of blue;

And then methought it did appear
A violet dropping dew:

I saw thee smile-thc sapphire’s bleze
Beside thee ceased to shine3

It could not match the living rnys
That fill’d that glauce of thine.

An clouds from yonder sun receive

A deep and mellow die,
Which scarce the ehade of coming eve

Can banish from the shy3
Thone smiles into the moodiest mind

Their own pure joy impert3
Their sunshine leaves a glow behind

That lightens 0'er the henrt.

The Imitctor.

An arrow from a bow just shot,

Flew upward to heaven’s campy,

And cried, with pompous sels-conceit,
Το the king engle, scornfully,

Loolr here !-I can as high as thou,
And, towards the sun, even higher scil!
lhc eagle smiled, and said, Ο scol,
What do thy horrowed plumes avril?
By others’ strength thou dost ascend,

But by thyself dost downward tend.
