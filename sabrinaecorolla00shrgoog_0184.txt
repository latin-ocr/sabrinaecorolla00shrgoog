150 SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Power os Leve.

The winde are high on Helle's wave,

As on that night of stormy water,
When Love, who sent, forgot to save
The young, the beautiful, the brave,

The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.
Oh, when at night along the sky
Her turrettorch was blazing high,
Though rising gale and breaking foam
And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
And clouds aloft and tides below,

With signs and sounds, forbade to go;
He could not see, he would not hear,

Or sound or sign foreboding fear3

His eye but saw that light of love,

The only star it hailed above 3

His ear but rang with Hero’s song,

“ Ye waveS, divide not lovers long.’'
That tale is old; but love auew

May nerve young hearts to prove as true.

Btnoa.
