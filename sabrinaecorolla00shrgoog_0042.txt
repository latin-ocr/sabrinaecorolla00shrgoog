8 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed

Into the wasteful deep. The monstrous sight
Struck them with horror buckward‚ but far worse
Urged them behind; headlong themselves they threw ¹
Dovvn from the verge of heaven: eternal wrsth
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

Hell heard the unsufferable noise, Hell saw
Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled
Affrighted3 but striot fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations. end too fast had bound.
Nine days they fell. Confounded Chaos mered,
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
Through his wild anarohy; so huge a rout
Encumbered him with ruin. Hel] at last
Yawning received them whole, and on them closed3
Hell their fit habitation, fraught with fite ,

Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.

An Epitaph.

He died, and left the world behind;

His once wild heart is eold3

His once keen eye is quelled and blind:
What more l-His taleis told.

He oame3 and baiing his heav’n-bright thought,
He earned the base world‘s ban;
And-having vainly lived and taught—
Gave place to a meaner man!
