SABRINAE conoul.

Stor oster Stor decoys.

How oft has the Benshee oried3

How oft has Death untied

Bright links 11111 Glory wove,

Sweet bonds entwined by Love!
Peaoe to each monly soul that sleepeth3
Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth3

Long may the fair and breve

Sigh o’er the hero’s grave!

We’ve fallen upon gloomy days,
Star after star decoys3
Every bright name that shed
Light o'er the land is fied.
Dari( falls the 1111 of him who mourneth
Lost joy or hope that ne'er returneth3
But brightly flows the teor
' Wept o’er 1 hero’s bier.

Oh, quenched are our beenon-lights:
Thou of tho hundred fights 3
Thou on whose buming tongue
Truth, peace, and freedom hung;
Both mute: but long 11 1110111 shineth,
Or mercy's soul at war repineth,
So long shall Erin's pride
Tell how they lived and died.
11110111.
