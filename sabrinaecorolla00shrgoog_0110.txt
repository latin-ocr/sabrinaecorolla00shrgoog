SABRINAE COROLLA.

Caledonia.

Ο Caledonia! stem and wild,

Meet nurse for a poetic child 3

Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,
Land of the mountain and the stood,
Land of my sires! what mortal hand
Can e'er untia the filial band

That knits me to thy ruggad strand!
still, as I view each well-known scene,
Think what is now, and what hath been,
Seems as, to me, of all bereft,

Sole friends thy woods and streams are left3
And thus I love them better still,

Even in extremity of ill.

By Yarrow's stream still let me stray,

Though none should guide my feeble way ς

still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,
Although it chill my wither’d cheek;
still lay my head by Taviot stone,
Though there, forgotten and alone,

The bard may draw his parting grean.

Scom.

Enigme.

Enfant de l'Ast, enfant de la Nature,

Plus je suis vrai, plus je suis imposture3
Sans prolonger la vie, J ’emptche de maurit,
Et je devians trop jaune, a force de vieillir.

Vommma.
