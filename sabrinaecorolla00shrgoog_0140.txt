1⁰6 SABRINAE coROLLh

The Hebrew Monarcb to hit Warriort.

Warriors and chiese, should the shaft or the sword
Pierce me in leading the bost of the Lord,
Heed not the corso, though a king’s‚ in your path3
Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath. ⁶

Thou who ost bearing my buckler and bow,

Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,

Stretoh me thot moment in blood ot thy feet3
Mine be the <loom which they dated not to meet.

Farewell to others3 but never we part,
Heir to my royalty, son of my heart;
Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway‚
Or kingly the death which awoits us to·day.

Broow.

Song.

A widow bird sat mourning for her love
Upon a wintry bough 3

The frozen wind kept on above,
The freezing stream below.

There was no leaf upon the forest bore,
No flower upon the ground3
And little motion in the air,

Except the mill-wheel's sound.
Saum.
