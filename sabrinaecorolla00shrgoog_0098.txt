64 SABRINAE COROLLA.

For by thy gracious golden glittering streame,
Ι trust to teste of truest Thisby's sight.
But stay-O spite!
But mark-poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here ἲ
Eyes‚ do you see?
How can it be?

O dainty duck! 0 dcar!

Thy mantle good,
What, stained with blood?

Approach, ye furies fell l

O fetes, come, come ἒ
Cut thread, and thrum!
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

*—

Obroatte aot tia Name.

O breathe nothis namo, let it sleep in the chade
Wherc cold and unhonour’d his relies are laid3

sad, silent, and dark be the tears that we shed,

As the night-dew that falls on the grass o'er his head!

But the night-dew that falls, though in silence it wcepa,
Shall brighten with verdurc the grave where he sleeps3
And the tear that we shed, though in secret it rolls,
Shall long keep his memory green in our souls.

Mooaa.
