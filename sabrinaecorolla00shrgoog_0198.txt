Autumn.

The Autumn is old,

The sere leaves are flying3
He heth gether'd up gold,
And now he is dying:

Old age, begin sighing.

The vintege is ripe,

The harvest is hosping3
But some that heve sow'd
Have no riohes for reeping:
Poor wretch‚ fall a weeping.

The year ’s in the wane,

There is nothing odorning;
The night hss‘no eve,

Cold winter gives warning.

The rivers run ohill‚

The red sun is sinking,

And the dsy has no morning:

And Ι am grown old, y

And life is fast shrinking:
Here 'e enow for sad thinking.

Hooo.

emet Men.

And shall they scorn Tre, Pol, and Peri,
And shall Trelawny die?

Then twenty thousand Comish rnen

Will know the resson why.
Comen Sors.
