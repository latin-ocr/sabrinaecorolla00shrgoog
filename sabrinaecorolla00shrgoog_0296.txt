262 SABRINAE COROLLA.

All T ltingt are Vanity.

When mirth is full and free,

Some sudden gloom will be:
When haughty power mounts high,
The watcher's axe is nigh.
All growth has boundÍ¾ when greatest found,
I t hastes to die.

When the rich town, that long
Has lain its huts among,
Reate its new structures vast,
And vaunts,-it shall not last.
Bright tints that shine are but the sign
Of summer past.

When, too, thine eye surveys
With fond adoring gaze

And yeaming beart thy friend,
Love to its grave doth tend.

All gith below, eave faith, but gron
Towarde an end.

Lm Arosnucn.
