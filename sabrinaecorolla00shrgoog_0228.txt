194 SABRINAE COROLLA.

'l’he Architect os Hell.

The aseending pile
Stood fixed her stately height3 aud straight the doors,

Opening their brazen folda, discover wide
Withiu her ample spaoes, o’er the smooth

And level pavement: from the arthed roof,
Pendent by subtle magio, many arow

Of starry lamps, and blazing crassata, fed
With naphtha and asphaltus, yielded light

As from a sky. The hasty multitude
Admiring enter’d3 and the work some praise,
And some the architect: his hand was known
In heaven by many a tower'd structure high,
Where sceptred angels held their residence,
And sat as princes3 whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,

anh in his hierarchy, the orders bright.

Nor was his name unheard or unadored

In ancient Graece3 and in Ausonian land
Men oall'd him Mulciber3 and how he fell
From heaven, they sabled, thrown by angry Jove
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn
To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,

A summer's day; and with the setting sun
Dropp’d from the zenith like a falling star,
On Lemnos, the AEgean isle: thus they relate,
Erring3 for he with this rebellious rout

Fell long before ; nor aught avail’d him now
To have built in heaven high towers3 nor did he scape

By all his engines, but was headlong sent

With his industrious crew to build in hell.
