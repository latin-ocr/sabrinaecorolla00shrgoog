180 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Τ lte Silene Laud.

Into the Silent Lnnd!
Ah, who shall lead us thither?
clouds in the evening sky more darkly gether,
And shotter'd wrecks lie thieker on the strand.
Who leads us with a gentle hand

Thither, oh thither,

Into the silent Lnndl

Into the Silent Land!
To you, ye boundlers regions
Of oll perfection, tendet morning visione
Of beauteous sonls, eternity’s own band.
who in life's battle firm doth stand,

shall bear hope's tender blossoms
Into the Silent Lnnd.

O Lnnd! Ο Lnnd!
For nll the broken-henrted
The mildest herald by onr fate allotted
BeekonS, end with inverted torch doth stand,
To lead us with a gentle hand
Into the land of all the great deperted,
· Into the Silent Laud!

Ionornnrow (from tle German of Snus).

Sleep dwell upon thino eyes, Pence in thy brenst!
Wonld I were Sleep and Pence, so sweet to rest
