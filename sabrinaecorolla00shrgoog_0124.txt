90 snutuNnE COROLLA.

T lte Chare.

Now my brave youths,
Now give a loose to the clean generous steed,
F lourish the whip, nor spare the galling spur3
But in the maduess of delight forget
Your fears. Far o'er the rooky hills we range,
And dangerous our course; but in the brave
True courage never faiis. In vain the stream
In foaming eddies whirls: in vain the ditch
Wide gasping‚ threatens death. The craggy steep,
Where the poor dizzy shepherd crawls with care,
And clings to every twig, gives us no pain3
But down we sweep, as stoops the falcon bold
To pounoe his prey. Then up the opponent hill,
By the swift motion slung, we mount alost:
So ships in winter seas now sliding sink
Adown the steepy wave, then toss’d on high,
Ride on the billows, and defy the storm.

What lengths we pass! Where will the wandering
chase

Lead us bewilder'd? Smooth as swallows skim
The new-shorn moad, and far more swist, we fly.
See my brave pack: now to the head they press,
J ostling in close array, then more diffuse
Obliquely wheel, while from their opening mouths
The vollied thunder breaks. So when the oranes

Their annual voyage steen with wanton wing
Their figure oft they change, and their loud clang
From cloud to cloud rebounds.

Souunvlma.
