SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Year.

In childhood, when, with engen eyes,
The seneen-measured year I viewed,
All, garbed in fairy guise,
Pledged constancy of good.

Spring sang of heaven; the summer flowers
memfflfflmffl3
Even suns o’er autumn’s bowers
Heard my strong wish, and stayed.

They came aud went, the short-lived four3
Yet, us their varying danee they wove,
To my young heart each bore
Its own sure claim os love.

Far different now !-the whirling year
Vainly my dizzy eyes pursue,
And its fair tints appear
All blent in one duel( hue.

Why dwell on rich autumnal lighte,
spring-time, or winter’s social ring?
Long days are fireside nights,
Brown autumn is fresh spring.

‘Ihen what this world to thee, my heart?
Its gifts nor feed thee nor can bless3

Thou haet no owner's part
In alliu fleetingness.
