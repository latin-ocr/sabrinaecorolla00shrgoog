138 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T he Solitary Poet.

There was a Poet, whose untimely tomb

No human hands with pious reverence rear'd,
But the eharm'd eddies of autumnal winds
Built 0'er his mouldering bones a pyramid

Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:
A lovely youth! No mourning maiden deck’d
With weeping flov'ers, or votive cyprees wreath,
The lone couch of his everlesting sleep:
Gentle, and breve, and generous, no lorn bard
Breathed o’er his dark fate one melodious sigh:
He lived, he died, he sung i'n solitude.
Strangers have wept to hear his passionete notes 3
And virgins, as unknown he past, have sigh’d
And wasted for fond love of his vvild eyes.

The fine of those solt orbs has ceased to burn,
And Silenee, too enemour'd of that voice,

Locks ite mute music in her rugged cell,
Senem.

Imcription for a Ligletlvouee.

F ar in the bosom of the deep,

O'er these vvild shelvee my watch I keep3
A ruddy gem of changeful light

Bound on the dusky brow of night:

The seaman bids my lustre hail,

And scoms to strike hie timorous saiL
