SABRINAE COROLLA.

Funera! Honours.

Oh, think not that with gerlands crown’d
Inhuman near thy grave we tread3
Or blushing roses scatter round,

Το mock the paleness of the dead.

What though we drain the fragrant howl‚
In flowers adorn'd and silken vest,

Oh, think not, brave departcd soul,
We revel to disturb thy rest.

Feign'd is the pleasure thet appears,
And false the triumph of our eyes,
Our draughts of joy ere dash'd with tears,
Our songs imperfect and in sighs.

We inly mourn : 0’er flowery pleins
Το roam in joyous trance is thine,
And pleasures unallied to prins,

Unfading sweets‚ immortal wine.
Burin.

u*—

On a Pipe in the Temple os Venus.

Say, rustic Pipe, in Cytherea's dome
Why sounds this echo of a shepherd's home? ’
Nor rocks nor valleys here invite the strain3
But all is Love- go seek thy hills again.

Horcsor (from the Greek Anthelopy).
