SABRINAE COROLLA.

Evening.

It is the honr when from the boughs
The nightingale's high note is heard;
It is the hour when lovers' vows
Seern sweet in every whisper’d word3
And gentle winds and waters near
Make music to the lonely ear.
Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
And in the sky the storo are met,
And on the ware is deeper blue,
And 011 the leaf a browner hue,
And in the heaven that clear obscure,

So softly dark and darldy pure,
Which follows the decline of day,
As twilight melts beneath the moon away.

The Mon who laad Nought.

There was a man, and he had nought,
And robbers came to rob him3

He got up the chimney-top,
And then they thought they had him.

He got down on th’ other side,
And then they could not find him;
He ren fourtecn miles in fifteen days,

And never looked behind him.
Gmnn Grnron.
