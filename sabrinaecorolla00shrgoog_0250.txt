216 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Satyrum. .

His loving mother came upon a day

Unto the woodes to see her little sonne3

And ehaunst unwares to meet him in the wey,

After his sportes and cruell pastime donne3

When after him a lyonesse did runne,

That roering all with rage did lowd sequere

Her children deare, whom he away had wonne:

The lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare,
And lull in rugged arms withouten childish feare.

The fearefull dame all quaked at the sight,
And turning beeke gan fast to fly awoy3

Untill‚ with love revolet from vaine affright,

She hardly yet persweded was to stay,
¹ And then to him these womanish words gan say:
“ Ah‚·· Satyrene, my dearling and my ioy,
For love of me leave off this dreadfull play 3
To dally thus with death is no fit toy:
Go, find some other play-fellones, mine own sweet boy.‘’

Jaclc.

J 'eck his own merit sees3 this gives him pride,
For he sees more than ell the world beside.
Eteonos homone.
