184 SABRINAE COROLLA. ν

To the Redbreast.

Unheard in summer’s flaring ray,
Pour forth thy notes, sweet singer,
Wooing the stillness of the autumn day3
Bid it a moment linger,
Nor fly

Τοο soon from winter’s scowling eye.

The blaekbird’s song at eventide‚
And her's who gay ascends,
Filling the heavens sar and wide,
Are sweet3 but none so blends

As thine

With calm deeay and peace divine.
ΚΜ.

Shyloclc.

Α Β. This is no answer‚ thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

S. Iam not bound to please thee with my answer.
B. Do all men kill the things they do not love?

S. Hates any man the thing he would not killt
B. Every offence is not a hate at first.

S. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee

twice?
Snnxsrmn.
