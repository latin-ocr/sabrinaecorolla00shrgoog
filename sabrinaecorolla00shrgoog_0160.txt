126 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ode on Solitede.

Heppy the man, whose wish and cere
A lew paterne] acres bound 3
Content to breathe his native air
ln his own ground.

Whose herds with milk, whose fields with breed,
Whose floclrs supply him with etrite,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
In winter fire.

Blest, who eon uneoneern'dly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,

In health of body, peace of mind,
Quies by day,

Sound sleep by night3 study and esse
Together mixt3 sweet recreationÍ¾
And innocense, which most doth please,
With meditation.

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown,
Thus unlamented let me die,
Steal from the world, and not a stone
Tell where I lie.

Grobeelzrist des Silvius.
