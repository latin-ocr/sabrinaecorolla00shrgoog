18 SABRINAE COROLLA.

Idyl.

Come down, Ο maid, from yonder mountain height;
For Love is of the velley3 come thou down,
And find him3 by the happy threshold, he,

Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,

Or red with spirted purple of the vate,

Or fox-like in the vine3 nor cares to wallr
With Death and Morning on the silver horns;
Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,
Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,

That huddling slent in furrow-cloven falls

To roll the torrent out of duslry doors.

But follow: let the torrent dance thee down

To find him in the valley3 let the wild
Lean-headed eagles yelp alone, and leave

The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill
Their thousand wreeths of dangling water-smoke,
That, like a broken purpose, waste in air:

So waste not thou, but come; for all the veles
Await thee; azure pillars of the heerth

Arise to thee; the children oall; and Ι

Thy shepherd pipe, end sweet is every sound—
Sweeter thy voice, hut every sound is sweet:
Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
The moen of doves in immemorial elms,

And murmuring of innumereble bees.
Trrrrsor.

Sproelre.
