246 snBRINAn COROLLA.

Tne coming Judgment.

The world is grown old, and her pleesures are past3
The world is grown old, and her form may not last3
The world is grown old, and trembles for sear:

For sorrows abound, and judgment is near.

The sun in the heaven is languid and pale,

And feeble and few are the fruits of the vale,
And the hearts of the natione fail them for seer: '
For the world is grown old, and judgment is near.

The king on his throne, the bride in her bower,
The children of pleasure, all feel the sad hour3
The roses are faded, and testeless the cheer:

For the world is grown old, and judgment is neor.

The world is grown old: but should we comphin,

Who have tried her, and know that her promise is vain l
Our heart is in heaven, our home is not here,

And we look for our erown when judgment is near.

Epitaph.

The thorny paths of life awhile she trod,
Then gently closed her eyes, end saw her God.
