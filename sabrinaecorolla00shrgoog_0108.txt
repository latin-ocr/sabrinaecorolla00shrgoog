SABRINAE COROLLA.

Grotitode.

What is grandeur, what is power?

Heavier toil, superior pain.

What the bright reward we gain?

The grateful memory of the good.

Sweet is the breath of verna] shower,

The bee's collected treasures sweet3

Sweet music’s melting fall ; but eweeter yet

The still small voice of gratitudo.
Gen.

Melody.

Come, rest in this bosom, my oven strichen deer3
Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still
here; ·

Here still is the smile that no cloud oen o’ercast,
And the heart and the hand all thy own to the last.

Oh, what was love made for, if 'tis not the seme

Through joy and through tormento, through glory and
c

I knowsfiffi·ask not, if guilt's in that heort-

I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.

Thou hest call’d me thy angel in momente of bliss,
And thy angel I’ll be, 'mid the horrore of this;

Through the fornace, unshrinhing, thy steps to pursue,
And shield thee, and save thee, or—perish there too.

Mooce.
