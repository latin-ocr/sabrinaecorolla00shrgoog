SABRINAE COROLLA.

A Roiny Doy.
T he day is cold and dark and doeary,

It rains, and the wind is never weary3
The vine still olings to the mouldering wall,
But at every gust the dead leaves fath

And the day is dark and dreary.

My life is cold and dark and dreary,

It haino, and the wind is never weary3

My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,

But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,
And my days are dark and dreary.

Be still, sad heart, and oease repining3
Behind the clouds is the sun still shining:
Thy fate is the common fate of all3 ’

’ Into each lise some rain must fall,

Somevdays must bo dark and dreary.

Louomoow.

Charlie.

Over the water ond over the lea,
And over the water to Charh'e.

Charlie loves good ale and wine,
And Chorlie loves good brandy

And Charlie loves a pretty lass,

As sweet as sogor-condy.
Jtoonm Souo.
