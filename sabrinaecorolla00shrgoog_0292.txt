Lines.

Unthinlring, idle, wild‚ and young,

Ι laughed and danced‚ and talked and sung 3
And fond of health, of freedom vain,
Dreamed not of sorrow, care, or pain3
Concluding in those houra of glee

'Ilrat all the world was made for me.

But when the hour of trial came,

And sickness shook this trembling frame3
When folly’s gay pursuits were o'er,

And I could dauce or sing no more 3-
It then occurred, how sad ’twould be,
Were this world only made for me.

Sweet are tlte uses osAdversity.

I have been honoured and oheyed,
Ι have met scorn and slight3

And my heart loves earth’s sober shade
More than her laughing light.

For what is rule but a aad weight
Of duty, and a snare?

What meauness, but with happier fate
The Saviour’s cross to share?

Thia my hid choico, though not from heaven,
Moves on the heavenward line ς

Cleanoe it, good Lord, from sinful leaven‚
And make it simply thine.
