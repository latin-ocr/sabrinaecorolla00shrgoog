SABRINAE conoLLA.

A Farewell.

Flow down, cold rivulat, to the sea,
Thy tribute-nave deliver3

No more by thee my steps shall be,
For ever and for ever.

Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
A rivulat, then a τίνεις

Νο where by thee my steps shall be,
For ever and for ever.

But here will sigh thine alden-trae,
And here thine aspen shiver,

And here by thee will hum the bee,
For ever and for ever.

A hundred suns will stream on thee,
A thousand moons will quiver3

But not by thee my steps shall be,

For ever and for ever.
Tannrson.

Epitaplt.

What thou art reading 0'er my bones
I’ve often read on other stones;
And others soon shall read of thee

What thou art reading now of me.
Fannmn.
