SABRINAE COROLLA.

To o Faithless Mistreor.

1 loved thee once, I'll love no more:

Thine be the grief, as thine the blame:
Thou art not what thou wast before:
What reason Ι should be the same?
He that ean love unloved again
Hath hetter store of love than hrain:

God send me love my debts to pay,
While unthrifts fool their love away.

Nothing could have my love o'erthrown,

If thou hadst still continued mine:
Yea, if thou ‘dst still remained thine own,

I might perchanee have yet been thino :
But thou thy freedom didst recall,
That it thou mightst elsewhere enthra13
And then how could Ι but disdain
A captive’s captive to romain?

Arromr.

Epitopl: oso Quorrehome Womou.

Here lies, thank Hermen, a woman who
Quarrelled and stormed her whole life through:
Tread gently o'er her mouldering form,

Or else you ’ll rouse another storm.
Wrorrmmm.
