SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Soldier Looer.

Tell me not, sweet‚ I am unkinde,
That from the nunnerie

Of thy chaste hreast and quiet minde
To war and arms I flie.

True‚ a new mistresse now I chose,
The first foe in the field3

And with a stronger saith embrace
A swerd, a horse, a shield.

Yet this inconstancy is such
As you too shall adore:
I could not love thee, dcere, so much,

Loved I not honoure more.
Lomhoc.

The Pimpernel.

See'st thou yon pimpernell An hour is past,
And he was holding dalliance with the sun,
All bared his crimson pride: now closed, downcast,
His blossoms seek their favourite skies to shun.
Young Edwin came, the warning change beheld,
Then hurried to his hinds3 and harh! Ihear
His loaded wagons creaking from the field3
For storius, he says, and migry hours, are near.
Oh! ‘mid the flowers life's tortuous path that strevi,
Is there not one like this? E'en es Ι speak,
Thy bosom-friends estranged look review‚
Remark his icy eye, his smileless cheek:
Adversity is nigh! Speed, counsel how

To sosten as thou mayest th’ inevitable blow.
R. W. E.
