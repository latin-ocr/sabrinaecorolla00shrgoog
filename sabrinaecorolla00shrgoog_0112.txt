SABRINAE cortoLLA.

Song os Comus.

The star that bids the shepherd sold,
Now the top of heaven doth hold;
And the gilded ear of day

His glowing axle doeh olley

In the ateep Atlantio stream 3

And the slope sun his upward beam
Shoots against the duslry pole,
Pacing toward the other goal

Of his chamber in the east.
Meanwhile, welcome joy and feast,

. Midnight shout and revehy,

Tipsy dance and J ollity.

Braid your looks with rosy twine,
Dropping odours, dropping wine.
Rigour now is gone to bed,

And advice with serupulous head,
Strict age and sour severity,

With their grave saws, in slumber lie.
We, that are of purer fire, ’
Imitate the starry quire,

Who in their nightly watchful spheres
Lead in swift round the months and years.

Mnron.
