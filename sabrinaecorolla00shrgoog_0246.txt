212 ι SABRINAE coROLLA.

Drinlcing Song of Munieh.

Sweet Iser‚ were thy sunny realm
And flowery gardens mine,

Thy waters Ι would shade with elm,
To prop the tender vine3

My golden flegons Ι would fill

With rosy drnughts from every hill;
And under every myrtle-bower

My gay companions should prolong

The laugh, the revel, and the song,
To many an idle honr.

Like rivers crimsoned with the beam
Of yonder planet bright,
Our bnlmy cups should ever stream
Profusion of delight.
No care should touch the mellow heart,
And sad or sober none depart3
For wine can triumph over wne,
And Love and Bacchus, brother powers,
Could build in Iser's sunny bowers
A paradise below.
Omnem.
