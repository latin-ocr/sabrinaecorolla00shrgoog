SABRINAE coaoLLa.

T Ire Bacch· T ree'a Petiliam.

Oh, leave this barren spot to me!

Sparc, woodman‚ spara the becchen tree Ξ
Though bush or flowret never grow

My dark unwarming shade below3

Nor summer bud perfume the dcw

Of rosy blush‚ or yellow hue;

Nor fruits of autumn, blossom-born‚

My green and glossy leaves adorn;

Nor murmuring tribes from me derivc
The ambrosial amber of the hive3

Yet leave this barren spot forme:

Spare, woodman‚ spate the beeehen trec!

Thrice twenty summere I have seen
The sky grow bright, the forest green3
And many a wintry wind have stood
In bloomless, fruitless solitude,

Since childhood in my pleasant bower
· First spent its sweet and spontive hour,
Since youthful lovers in my shade
Their vows of truth and raptura madc3
And on my trunk's surviving frame
Carved many a long-forgotten name.
Oh! by the sighs of gentle sound,
First breatbed upon this sacred ground ;
By al] that Love has whisper'd here,
Or Beauty heard with ravish’d ear3

As Love's own altar, honour me:

Spare, woodman‚ spare the beeehen trec!
Gamerae.
