84 SABRINAE COROLLA„

The Fond Lover.

Why so pale and wan, fond lover?
Prithee‚ why so pale?

Will, when looking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevail?
Prithee‚ why so pale?

Why so dull and mute, young sinner?
Prithee‚ why so mute?

will, when speaking well oan't win her,
Saying nothing do't?
Prithee‚ why so mute?

Quit, quit for shame3 this will not move,
This cannot take her:

Ifof herself she will not love,
Nothing can make her.
Let who will take her!

———..a-

In a Chnrchyord ot Elgin.

Life is a city with many a street;
Death is the market where all men meet:

If Life were a thing which gold could huy,
The poor could not live, and the rich would not die.
