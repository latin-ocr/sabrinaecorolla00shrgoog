ta SABRINAE COROLLA.

Ever round your midnight bed
Horrid sprites shall haunt you,

H. I'll wed another, like my dear,
Nancy, Nancy3
Then all hell will fly for sear,

My sponse Nancy.

To Phyllis.

Phyllis, why should we delay

Pleasures shorter than the day?

Could we (which we never can)

Stretch our lives beyond their span,

Beauty like a shsdow flies,

And our youth before us dies:

Or, would youth and beauty stay,

Love harh wings, aad will away.

Love hath swifter wings than Time,

Change in Love to heav'n does climb3

Gods, that never change their state,

Vary oft their love and hate.
Phyllis! to this truth we owe

All the love betwixt us two.

Let not you and Î™ inquire

What has been our past desire3

On what shepherd you have smiled,

Or what nymphs I have beguiled:

Leave it to the planets too

What we shall hereafter do:

For the joys we now may prove,
T alre advice of present love.

Watrna
