SABRINAE COROLLA.

The Lea-mg.

When o'er the hill the eastern ster
Tells bughtin’-time ie near, my jo;
And owsen frae the furrow’d field
Retum sae dowf and wem-y, O!
Down by the burn, where scented birks
Wi’ dew are hangin' clear, my jo,
I'll meet thee en the lea-rig,
My ain kind denrie, 0!

In mirkest ylen, at midnight hour
I’d rove and ne’er be eene, O!

If through that glen Ι gaed to thee,
My ain kind dearie, O!

Although the night were ne'er sae wild‚
And I were ne'er sae weary, Ο !

I'd meet thee on the lea-rig,

My ain kind reare, οε

The hunter lo'es the mornin’ sun,

To ronse the mountain deer, my j03
At noon the fisher seeks the glen,

Alang the burn no steen, my jo.
Gi’e me the hour of gloamin’ gray,

It makes my heart sae cheerie, O!
To meet thee on the lea-rig,

My ain kind denne, 0!

Nohody at Home.

You beat your pate, and fancy wit will come:

Knock as you will, there’s nobody at home.
Swrrr.
