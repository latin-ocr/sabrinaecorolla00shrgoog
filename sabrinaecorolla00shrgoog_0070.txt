SABRINAE conone.

Far o’er the Sea.

Where ane the vintage-songs
Wandering in glee?

Where dance the pensant-bande
J oyous and free?

Under a kind blue sky

Where doth my birth-place lie ἳ-
Mfflmm

Where floate the myrsseecent
O'er vale and lea,

When evening calls the dove
Homewards to fiee?

Where doth the orange gleam

soft on my native stream 2-
Far o'er the sea.

Where are eweet eye· of love
Watching forme,
Where 0’er the cabin-roof
Waves the green tree?
Where speaks the vesper-chime
still of a holy time 2-
Far 0'e1· the see.

Dance on, ye vintagebands,
Fearless and free3

still fresh and greenly nave
My father's tree ;
