SABRINAE COROLLA.

Winter.

The mill-wheel’s frozen in the stream,
The chureh is deok’d with holly3

Mistletoe hange from the kitchen-beam,
To fright away melancholy3

Icicles elink in the milhmaid’e pail,
Younkers skate on the pool below,

Blackbirds perch on the garden-rail;

And hark, how the cold winda blow!

There goes the equire to ehoot at enipe3
Here runs Diok to fetch alog3

You’d swear his breath was the smolre of a pipe
In the frosty morning fog.

Hodge is breaking the ice for the kine3
Old and young cough aa they g03

The round red sun forgets to shine3

And hark, how the cold winds blow!

Homer Sarra.

——..-

Linerfrom the German.

Let me wonder where she walke
In the blessed calm of even ;
Let me listen when she talks3

Jove, I envy not thy heaven.

Love within my bosom’s cell
Hermit-like doth ever dwell:
Hope and J oy may leave my heart;

Love and I will never part.
