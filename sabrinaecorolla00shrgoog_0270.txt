2³6 snunlunu COROLLA.

The Deoth ostie Breve.

Forewell‚ thou fair day, thou green earth, and ye siries,
Now gay with the bright setting sun;

Farewell, loves and friendship8, ye deor tendet ties;
Our rece of existence is run.

Thou grim king of terrore, thou life’s gloomy foe,
Go, frighten the coward and slave 3

Go, teeeh them to tremble‚ fell tyram, but know
No terrors host thou to the brave.

Thou strik'st the dull peasant‚ he sinks in the dark,
Nor savos e’en the wreck of a name3

Thou strik'st the young hero—a glorious mark-
He falls in the blaze of his fame.

Iu the field of proud honour, our swords in our hands,
Our king and our country to save,
While victory shines on life’s lost ebbing sands,
Oh, who would not rest with the breve?
Moonr.

a—-—

' On a Lourel beside α- Foontoin.

Rest thee beneath yon laurel‘s ample shade,
And quaff the limpid stream that issues there3

So thy worn frome, for summer's toil repaid,
May feel the sreshness of the western air.

Houosou (frum the Greek Anthology).
