66 SABRINAE COROLLA.

T lte Laud of tte Suc.

Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle
Are emblems of deeds that credone in their clime3
Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle‚
Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?
Know ye the land of the cedar and tine,
Where the flowers ever blocsom, the beams ever shine3
Where the light wings of zephyr, oppressed with per-
sume,
Wax faint 0'er the gardens of Gril in her bloom;
Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit,
And the voice of the nightingnle never is mute3
Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky,
In eolour though varied, in beauty may vie,
And the purple of ocean is deepest in dye3
Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine‚
And all, save the spirit of man, is divine?
’Tis the clime of the East-’tis the Lnnd of the Sun;
Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done t
Oh! wild as the accents of lovers’ farewell
Are the hearts which they bear, and the tales which
' they tell.
