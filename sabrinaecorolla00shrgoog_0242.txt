20⁸ SABRINAE COROLLA.

Anacreontis.

Undemeath this myrtle shade,
On flowery beds supinely laid,
With odorous oils my head o'erflowing,
And around it rosea growing,

What should Ι do but drink away
The heat and troubles of the day t
ln this more than kingly state
Love himself shall on me wait.
Fill to me, Lora, nay, fill it up3
And mingled cast into the cup
Wit and mirth and noble firea,

Vigorous health and gay desires.
Cowanr.

The Vanity os Life.

When Ι consider life, ’tis all a cheat;

Yet, fool’d with hope, men favour the deceit,

Trust on, and think to·morrow will repayz

To-morrow'a falser than the former day,

Lies worse3 and while it says, we shall be bless'd

With some new joys, outa off what we possessed.

Strange coz'nage! none would live past years again,

Yet all hope pleasure in what yet romain,

And from the dregs of life think to receive

What the first sprightly running could not give.

I'm tired with waiting for thia chymie gold,

Which fools us young, and beggars us when old.
Damna.
